# Phone Book

## Description

Create a program which implements a phone book, allowing to list, add and delete phone book entries.
We recommend to store the phone book in files using [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format.

### UI / Main menu

User interface (UI) should contain operation choices e.g.
```txt
Choose your action:
1) List all entries.
2) Add new entry.
3) Remove an entry by ID.
```

The database should be read once on startup, and saved every time new entry is added, or an existing
entry is removed.

### Listing entries

Entries should be sorted by last name and listed with 20 elements pagination. It means that every 20
entries a user should confirm to see next 20 (or less). E.g.

```txt
ID              Last Name                First Name                Phone#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4               Bar                      Foo                       +33333333333
7               Buba                     Pupkin                    +11111111111
...
3               Foo                      Bar                       +22222222222
Press <ENTER> to continue...
ID              Last Name                First Name                Phone#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1               Samcuks                  Jaroslavs                 +41123456789
2               Zaichenkov               Pavel                     +41987654321
```

Note: IDs are auto-incremented for every new entry and aren't necessary sorted.

After the last entry the main menu should be displayed again.

### Adding new entries

- IDs should be auto-assigned and greater than any existing ID.
- Names, last names and phone numbers should be entered from the keyboard.
- Names and last names could be duplicated.

### Removing entries

- A user is asked to enter entry ID, which is then removed from the database.
- Optional confirmation messages could be shown.

## JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a popular formating allowing to store or transmit data.
Go provides an [encoding/json](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json) package that implements encoding and
decoding operations.

In the examples below we use the following structure:

```go
type Entry struct {
  ID          uint32
  FirstName   string
  LastName    string
  PhoneNumber string
}
```

and the following constants:

```go
const phonebookFile = "phonebook.json"
```

### Encoding to a file

```go
entries := []Entry{
  {1, "Jaroslavs", "Samcuks", "+41123456789"},
  {2, "Pavel", "Zaichenkov", "+41987654321"},
}

f := MustCreateFile(phonebookFile)
defer f.Close()
w := bufio.NewWriter(f)
defer w.Flush()
if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(entries); err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### Decoding from a file

```go
var entries []Entry

f := MustOpenFile(phonebookFile)
defer f.Close()
if err := json.NewDecoder(bufio.NewReader(f)).Decode(&entries); err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

fmt.Println(entries)
```
